When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

    To backup the work and allow others to collaborate in the project 
    development.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To fix collisions when collaborating.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    * forks are intended to clone the repository from github to github
      providing track of the ancestor repository (developed by other user)
    * clon is intended to download a ithub repository into the local directory.
    * branch is to hold different versiones in the local directory or 
      staging area.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to control changes and fix inconsistencies between my work
    and the work done by other team members.
