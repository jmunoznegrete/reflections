What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates the metadata and initialices it to control the versions 
    and changes of every file and items.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The working area holds the working copies of the files already added to the
    repository. When commit is executed, these files are stored in the 
    repository. The working directory holds many other files (executables, ...)
    No control version is performed until the files are added to the staging
    area. add command has to be executed to enable the files into the staging
    area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    Just only adding the files modified to the staging area and then commiting
    the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
    There are two main situations:
    * When a new feature is going to be implemented to try.
    * When an experiment is ging to be implemented to see how it works.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    To visualize and have a mind map of what is going on in the software.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
    The merged version is pointing to two ancestors. Both set of files, 
    including the changes are merged into only one set of files.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
    Git automatic: manual actions are minimized, so errors do.
    Manual: sometimes is required to resolve conflicts. In this case, automatic
    commits could cause a los of colateral errors.
