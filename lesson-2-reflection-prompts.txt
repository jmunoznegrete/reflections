What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates the metadata and initialices it to control the versions 
    and changes of every file and items.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The working area holds the working copies of the files already added to the
    repository. When commit is executed, these files are stored in the 
    repository. The working directory holds many other files (executables, ...)
    No control version is performed until the files are added to the staging
    area.

change?
